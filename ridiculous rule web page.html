      <h1>The Most Ridiculous Rule</h1>

<p1>On time I was working in a restaurant and as the hostess, we have to dry the silverware. There was a lot of it so I asked for help from a waitress who didn't have any tables. My boss comes to me and yells (in spanish btw) that NO ONLY HOSTESSES are allowed to dry the silverware. So no help for me.</p1>
<h2> I ended up quitting this job...</h2>
<p2> In the end, I quit this job because my boss had all these ridiculous expectations and he just sat in his office all day. (mind you, I was a hostess so it's not a strenuous job in the first place) His wife was so boujee and annoying and I quit after only 5 months!</p2>
